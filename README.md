# 🍔 Fast Food Data Analysis Project
This project aims to spread the awareness of the nutritional values of fast-food chain all across North America. This Repo contains a Python-based data file (Jupyter) which thoroughly compares each major food chains nutritional values such as calories, fats, carbs, etc... The purpose of this project is to provide consumers with proper insight into what they put in their bodies.

## 🔎 Project Overview
The rise of fast food has transformed eating habits by offering convenience and simplicity, with brands like McDonald's and Subway becoming staples in daily life. However, the increasing consumption of fast food raises concerns about its impact on public health. To explore these concerns, the Fast Food Nutrition dataset from Kaggle provides insights into the nutritional profiles of various fast-food items. This project aims to analyze and compare the nutritional values of these items, examining factors like calories, cholesterol, and sugar intake to determine which chains offer the healthiest options.
